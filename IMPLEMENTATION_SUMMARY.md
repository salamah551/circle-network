## Overview
This implementation adds three major features to prepare the Circle Network application for launch:
1. PostHog Analytics Integration
2. Automated Pricing Tier System (Founding 50)
3. Copy and Messaging Refinements

## Security Summary
✅ **CodeQL Security Scan: PASSED**
- No security vulnerabilities detected
- All code follows security best practices
- Server-side validation implemented for pricing checks
- Proper authentication and authorization in place

## Feature 1: PostHog Analytics Integration

### Files Created/Modified:

- **Three pricing tiers**:
  - **Founding Member**: $2,497/year (limited to first 50 members)
  - **Premium**: $4,997/year (standard tier)
  - **Elite**: $9,997/year (includes Q1 2026 AI features)
- **Frontend updates**:
  - Real-time availability banners showing remaining spots
  - "SOLD OUT" banner when founding slots are full
  - Premium and Elite tiers appear when founding is full
  - Dynamic price display with savings calculations

### API Endpoint:
```
GET /api/founding-members/count

Response:
{
  "count": 12,

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist:

#### PostHog Analytics:
- [ ] Install PostHog browser extension to verify events
- [ ] Test page view tracking by navigating between pages
- [ ] Test user sign-up tracking by completing authentication
- [ ] Test checkout initiation tracking by clicking checkout button
- [ ] Test payment conversion tracking with a test Stripe payment

#### Pricing System:
- [ ] Verify founding member count endpoint returns correct data
- [ ] Test checkout with < 50 founding members (should show founding tier)
- [ ] Test checkout with >= 50 founding members (should switch to premium)
- [ ] Verify UI updates when founding spots are full
- [ ] Test all three tier selections (founding, premium, elite)

#### Copy and Emails:
- [ ] Verify welcome email sends on successful payment
- [ ] Test founding member welcome email variant
- [ ] Test standard member welcome email variant
- [ ] Verify all copy displays correctly on subscribe page
- [ ] Test ROI calculator with updated pricing

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Founding Member Available (< 50)**:
   - Subscribe page should show founding tier prominently
   - Availability banner should show spots remaining
   - Checkout should use founding price ID

2. **Founding Member Full (>= 50)**:
   - Subscribe page should show "SOLD OUT" banner
   - Premium and Elite tiers should be displayed
   - Checkout should use premium/elite price IDs

3. **PostHog Events**:
   - Sign in → `user_signed_in` event with user details
   - Click checkout → `checkout_initiated` event with plan details
   - Complete payment → `payment_successful` event with transaction details

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# PostHog
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_your_project_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://app.posthog.com

# Stripe Pricing
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_FOUNDING=price_founding_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM=price_premium_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ELITE=price_elite_id

# Existing (no changes)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
SENDGRID_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=...
```

## Database Requirements

### Supabase Schema:
The implementation assumes the following columns exist in the `profiles` table:
- `is_founding_member` (boolean): Marks founding members
- `full_name` (text): User's full name for personalization
- `status` (text): User's membership status
- `subscription_status` (text): Subscription status
- `stripe_customer_id` (text): Stripe customer ID

No schema changes are required if these columns already exist.

## Key Benefits

1. **Complete Conversion Tracking**: Full visibility into user journey from page view to payment
2. **Automated Scarcity**: Real-time enforcement of "Founding 50" limit without manual intervention
3. **Enhanced Value Proposition**: Clear messaging on savings and guarantees to drive conversions
4. **Personalized Experience**: Welcome emails tailored to founding vs. standard members
5. **Zero Maintenance**: System automatically switches tiers when limit is reached

## Next Steps

1. **Configure PostHog**: Create PostHog project and add keys to environment variables
2. **Set Up Stripe Prices**: Create three price objects in Stripe and add IDs to env vars
3. **Test Payment Flow**: Complete end-to-end test with Stripe test mode
4. **Monitor Analytics**: Verify PostHog events are being captured correctly
5. **Optimize Copy**: A/B test different messaging variations based on conversion data

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the system can be rolled back by:
1. Removing PostHog environment variables (analytics will safely not initialize)
2. Setting founding member count to 0 in database (will always show premium/elite)
3. Reverting to previous commit: `git revert HEAD~2`

All changes are backward compatible and fail gracefully if environment variables are not set.
