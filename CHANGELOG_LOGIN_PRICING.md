   - Site URL: `https://thecirclenetwork.org` (MUST include .org)
   - Redirect URLs:
     - `https://thecirclenetwork.org/**`
     - `https://*.vercel.app/**`
     - `http://localhost:5000/**`

2. **In Vercel → Project Settings → Environment Variables:**
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Testing Validation

✅ Build completes successfully
✅ No hard crashes when env vars missing in development
✅ Pre-render errors are expected for auth-protected pages
✅ All pricing references updated to monthly model
✅ Code review completed with feedback addressed
✅ Security scan passed (0 vulnerabilities)

## Security Notes

- OPS_API_KEY and secrets remain server-side only

- No client-side exposure of sensitive configuration

## Migration Notes

When deploying to production:
1. Verify Supabase Site URL is set to exact production domain
2. Ensure all Redirect URLs are whitelisted
3. Confirm NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_* env vars are set in Vercel
4. Test login flow and /admin/ops access with proper credentials
5. Verify pricing displays correctly on subscribe page
