# Personalized Onboarding Flow Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a seamless, personalized onboarding flow for new members after they complete registration and payment. The experience is tier-specific and includes a needs assessment quiz to customize the member's dashboard.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Database Schema Changes
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251028_needs_assessment.sql`

Added two new columns to the `profiles` table:
- `needs_assessment` (JSONB) - Stores quiz responses including:
  - `industry` - Member's primary professional landscape
  - `goals` - Array of up to 2 selected leverage areas
  - `travelFrequency` - Travel frequency (0-100 scale)
  - `motivation` - Optional text about what they hope to achieve
  - `completedAt` - ISO timestamp of completion
- `needs_assessment_completed_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - When quiz was completed
- Added index for performance optimization

### 2. User Flow Changes
**Modified:** `app/api/stripe/checkout/route.js`

Changed the Stripe checkout success redirect:
- **Before:** `success_url: .../dashboard?welcome=true&tier=${tierName}`
- **After:** `success_url: .../welcome?tier=${tierName}`

This ensures new members are sent to the personalized onboarding flow immediately after payment.

### 3. Welcome Screen
**Files:**
- `app/welcome/page.jsx` (Server component with route protection)
- `app/welcome/WelcomeClient.jsx` (Client component)

**Features:**
- Tier-specific messaging:
  - **Inner Circle (Founding Member):**
    - Headline: "Welcome to the Inner Circle, Founder."
    - Subheadline: "Your role in shaping our collective begins now. Before you enter, let's calibrate your experience."
    - CTA: "Begin Calibration"
  - **Core (Charter Member):**
    - Headline: "Welcome, Charter Member."
    - Subheadline: "We're thrilled to have you in our foundational community. Let's personalize your experience to unlock its full potential."
    - CTA: "Begin Personalization"
- Clean, full-screen design with amber accent colors
- Skip option to go directly to dashboard
- Route protection: requires active subscription, redirects if already completed

### 4. Needs Assessment Quiz
**Files:**
- `app/welcome/quiz/page.tsx` (Server component with route protection)
- `app/welcome/quiz/NeedsAssessmentQuiz.tsx` (Client component)

**Four Questions (one per screen):**

1. **Industry Focus**
   - Prompt: "What is your primary professional landscape?"
   - UI: Searchable dropdown with 21 industry options
   - Required: Yes
   - Industries include: Technology, Finance, Healthcare, Real Estate, etc.

2. **Goal Prioritization**
   - Prompt: "Which area of leverage is most critical for you right now? (Select up to two)"
   - UI: Multi-select cards with descriptions
   - Required: Yes
   - Options:
     - Cost & Vendor Savings
     - Competitive Intelligence
     - High-Value Networking
     - Travel Optimization
     - Investment & Deal Flow

3. **Travel Profile**
   - Prompt: "How often does your work take you on the road?"
   - UI: Slider with 5 labeled options
   - Required: Yes
   - Options: Rarely (0), Quarterly (25), Monthly (50), Weekly (75), Constantly (100)

4. **The "Why"**
   - Prompt: "In one sentence, what do you hope to achieve as part of The Circle?"
   - UI: Single-line text input (200 char max)
   - Required: No (skippable)

**Features:**
- Progress bar showing completion percentage
- Back/Next navigation
- Form validation with error messages
- Success screen with redirect to dashboard
- Elegant, one-question-per-screen design
- Consistent with existing app styling (black background, amber accents)

### 5. API Endpoint
**File:** `app/api/needs-assessment/save/route.ts`

**Endpoint:** POST `/api/needs-assessment/save`

**Features:**
- Bearer token authentication
- Input validation for all required fields
- Stores data in `profiles.needs_assessment` JSONB column
- Sets `needs_assessment_completed_at` timestamp
- Uses admin Supabase client for secure updates
- Returns success/error responses

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "industry": "Technology",
  "goals": ["networking", "competitive-intel"],
  "travelFrequency": 50,
  "motivation": "Build strategic partnerships in the AI space"
}
```

### 6. Route Protection
Both `/welcome` and `/welcome/quiz` pages include:
- Authentication check (redirects to `/login` if not authenticated)
- Subscription status check (redirects to `/subscribe` if not active)
- Completion check (redirects to `/dashboard` if already completed)
- Ensures onboarding can only be accessed once

## User Experience Flow
