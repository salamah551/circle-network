This directory contains legacy documentation and artifacts that have been superseded by the strategy alignment refactor.

## Contents

### Documentation
- **LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md** - Pre-launch checklist for the original founding member launch strategy
- **UI_CHANGES.md** - UI changes related to countdown timers and founding member features
- **email-templates.md** - Legacy email template sequences for invite campaigns and waitlist

## Context

These files were part of the original launch strategy that included:
- Time-gated "Founding 50" membership model
- Countdown timers and launch date mechanics
- Waitlist and invite-only flow

The platform has since evolved to:
- Tier-based capabilities model (Inner Circle and Core memberships)
- "The World's First AI-Enhanced Private Network" positioning
- Immediate access with ARCâ„¢ capabilities differentiation

## Reference Only

These files are kept for historical reference and should not be used for current development.
For current documentation, see:
- README.md (main project documentation)
- STRATEGY.md (current positioning and strategy)
