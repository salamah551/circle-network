# Archive

This directory contains legacy files from previous strategic directions and implementations.

## Purpose

Files here are preserved for historical reference but are no longer used in the live application. They document past approaches and can be referenced during troubleshooting or to understand the evolution of the platform.

## Structure

- **`emails/legacy/`** — Email templates from the "Founding 50" era (Oct 2025 and earlier)
- **`docs/legacy/`** — Documentation from previous strategic directions

## When to Use This

- **Historical reference:** Understanding past decisions and implementations
- **Troubleshooting:** Comparing old vs. new approaches if issues arise
- **Rollback:** (rare) If emergency rollback is needed, these files show previous state

## Do NOT Use These Files

- ❌ Do not reference these files in active code
- ❌ Do not copy messaging or pricing from these templates
- ❌ Do not restore these files without consulting the team

## Migration History

### October 28, 2025: Inner Circle / Core Migration

**What Changed:**
- Migrated from "Founding 50/Premium/Elite" model to "Inner Circle (Founding Member)/Core (Charter Member)" model

- Updated pricing: Inner Circle $25,000/year, Core $3,500/year (lifetime rate)
- Updated positioning: "The World's First AI-Enhanced Private Network"

**Files Archived:**
- Email templates referencing old tiers and pricing
