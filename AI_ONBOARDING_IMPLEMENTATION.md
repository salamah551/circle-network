# AI-Centric Onboarding and Growth Strategy Implementation

## Summary

This implementation adds a complete, end-to-end AI-centric onboarding and growth strategy for the Circle Network launch, including:

1. **Email Templates** - 8 markdown templates for founding and standard member sequences
2. **Launch Phase Management** - Automated tier switching at 50 founding member threshold
3. **AI Onboarding Concierge** - Backend API and conversational UI wizard
4. **Landing Page Enhancements** - Invite link greeting and AI Suite sections
5. **Feature Gating** - Premium vs Elite tier access control in dashboard

## Implementation Details

### Part 1: Email Templates

Created `/emails` directory with 8 structured markdown template files:

**Founding Member Sequence (4 emails):**
1. `founding-member-1-intrigue.md` - Initial intrigue and invitation
2. `founding-member-2-value.md` - Value proposition and ROI
3. `founding-member-3-trust.md` - Social proof and testimonials
4. `founding-member-4-urgency.md` - Final urgency and deadline

**Standard Member Sequence (4 emails):**
1. `standard-member-1-invitation.md` - Initial invitation
2. `standard-member-2-proof.md` - Member impact and testimonials
3. `standard-member-3-tiers.md` - Premium vs Elite tier comparison
4. `standard-member-4-final-call.md` - Final reminder

Each template includes:
- YAML frontmatter with metadata (subject, audience, purpose, variant, variables)
- Structured sections: Hook, Value, Proof, CTA, Footer
- Variable placeholders: `{{first_name}}`, `{{invite_code}}`, `{{apply_url}}`, `{{deadline}}`
- Clear content sections ready for final copy

**Email Template Loader:**
- Created `lib/email-templates.ts` with utilities to load and parse templates
- Function to replace variables in content
- Helper to get template name based on launch phase and sequence stage
- Does not change existing sending engine (non-breaking)

### Part 2: Backend Logic

#### A) Automated Tier & Email Switching

**lib/launch-phase.ts:**
- `getCurrentLaunchPhase(supabaseAdmin)` - Queries founding member count
  - Returns `{ phase: 'founding', priceId }` when count < 50
  - Returns `{ phase: 'standard', priceIds }` when count >= 50
- `isFoundingPhase(supabaseAdmin)` - Helper to check current phase
- `getFoundingMemberStatus(supabaseAdmin)` - Get status for display

**Integration Points:**
- Subscribe page (`app/subscribe/page.js`) - Already uses founding member API to show appropriate tiers
- Bulk invite sender (`app/api/bulk-invites/track/send/route.js`) - Now checks launch phase to determine email sequence
  - Uses founding sequence when phase is 'founding'
  - Uses standard sequence when phase is 'standard'
  - Logs phase decision for debugging

#### B) AI Onboarding Concierge Backend

**API Route: POST /api/onboarding/calibrate**
- Location: `app/api/onboarding/calibrate/route.ts`
- Auth required (Bearer token)
- Payload fields:
  - `strategicGoal` (required)
  - `dealPreferences` (optional)
  - `reputationKeywords` (optional)
  - `industries` (optional)
  - `geos` (optional)
  - `competitorWatch` (optional)
- Persists to `profiles.onboarding_profile` JSONB column
- Sets `onboarding_completed` and `onboarding_completed_at` flags
- Fallback to individual columns if JSONB doesn't exist
- Returns `{ success: true }` on completion

### Part 3: Frontend Changes

#### A) Landing Page Enhancements

**Invite Link Greeting (`app/landing-client.jsx`):**
- Checks URL parameters for `?name=` and `?code=` (or `?invite=`)
- Displays personalized greeting banner when name is present
- Shows invite code in styled badge
- Example: "Welcome, **John** — your private invitation is active"

**AI-Powered Onboarding Section:**
- New section added after AI Features Tabs
- Describes 4-step calibration process:
  1. Tell us your strategic goals
  2. Define your ideal connections
  3. Set your deal flow preferences (Elite)
  4. Configure reputation monitoring (Elite)
- Time to first value display: "Under 7 Days"
- Shows onboarding timeline breakdown
- Highlights "First Intros arrive next Monday"

#### B) AI Onboarding Concierge Frontend

**Onboarding Wizard Component (`app/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx`):**
- Client-side React component with multi-step form
- 6 conversational steps:
  1. Strategic goal (textarea, required)
  2. Deal preferences (textarea, optional)
  3. Industries (multi-select, required)
  4. Geographies (multi-select, required)
  5. Reputation keywords (textarea, optional)
  6. Competitor watch (textarea, optional)
- Features:
  - Progress bar showing completion percentage
  - Next/Back navigation
  - Skip option for optional fields
  - Form validation
  - Success state with redirect to dashboard
  - Error handling

**Page Wrapper (`app/onboarding/start/page.tsx`):**
- Server component that checks authentication
- Redirects to login if not authenticated
- Access gated (post-payment ideal, but allows authenticated users)
- Renders OnboardingWizard component

#### C) Feature Gating UI (Already Implemented)

**Dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.js`):**
- Elite AI Features section with tier-based access
- Shows "Upgrade to Elite" CTA for Premium members
- Shows "Coming Q1 2026" status for Elite/Founding members
- `LockedFeatureCard` component handles three states:
  1. Locked - Shows lock icon, upgrade CTA
  2. Coming Soon - Shows clock icon, launch date, founding member note
  3. Active - Would show full feature (when launched)

**Deal Flow Page (`app/deal-flow/page.js`):**
- Two states based on user tier:
  1. **Locked State (Premium)**: Shows lock banner, feature preview, "Upgrade to Elite" CTA
  2. **Coming Soon State (Elite/Founding)**: Shows launch date, criteria form preview (disabled)
- Example alert preview for all users
- Already fully implemented

### Part 4: Database Considerations

**Recommended Schema Additions:**

```sql
-- Add onboarding_profile JSONB column to profiles table (if not exists)
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS onboarding_profile JSONB,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS onboarding_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS onboarding_completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Create index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_onboarding_completed 
ON profiles(onboarding_completed);

-- The API has fallback logic to work with existing schemas
```

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables (already in use):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_FOUNDING`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ELITE`

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Phase Switching Test
```javascript
// Simulate 49 founding members
// Expected: Subscribe page shows Founding tier
// Expected: Bulk invite uses founding-member-* templates

// Simulate 50 founding members
// Expected: Subscribe page shows Premium + Elite tiers
// Expected: Bulk invite uses standard-member-* templates
```

### 2. Invite Link Greeting Test
- Visit landing page: `/?name=John&code=CN-XXXX-XXXX`
- Expected: Banner shows "Welcome, John — your private invitation is active"
- Expected: Code displayed in badge

### 3. Onboarding Flow Test
- Log in as authenticated user
- Navigate to `/onboarding/start`
- Complete wizard (6 steps)
- Expected: Data saved to database
- Expected: Redirect to `/dashboard`
- Expected: Success message shown

### 4. Feature Gating Test
**Premium Member:**
- Navigate to `/deal-flow`
- Expected: Lock banner with "Upgrade to Elite" CTA
- Expected: Feature preview shown

**Elite/Founding Member:**
- Navigate to `/deal-flow`
- Expected: "Coming Q1 2026" banner
- Expected: Criteria form preview (disabled)
- Expected: "Included in Your Founding Membership" note (founding only)

### 5. Build Test
```bash
npm run build
# Expected: Clean build with no errors
# Actual: ✓ Build successful (verified)
```
