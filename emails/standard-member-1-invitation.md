Hi {{first_name}},

I'd like to invite you to join Circle Network. We're a private community where accomplished professionals get matched with 3 strategic connections every week using AI.

The platform is now open to a limited group, and you're one of them.

Here's how it works: every Monday, our AI analyzes your goals and expertise to recommend 3 connections that make sense for you. You see why each match matters, accept the ones you want, and we handle the introduction.

Everyone in the network is vettedâ€”tech founders, investors, executives, advisors. It's not LinkedIn. It's a curated group of people who can actually help you achieve your goals.

We have two membership tiers:

Premium ($4,997/year): AI-powered introductions, member directory, messaging, events, deal flow marketplace access.

Elite ($9,997/year): Everything in Premium plus AI Deal Flow Alerts, Reputation Guardian, and Competitive Intelligence (launching Q1 2026).

Both include a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Your invitation code is {{invite_code}} and expires in {{deadline}} days.

Does this sound useful for you? {{apply_url}}

Best,
Shehab Salamah
Founder, Circle Network

P.S. When you join, you'll complete a brief onboarding to customize your experience. First introductions arrive the following Monday.
