Hi {{first_name}},

Wanted to follow up on your Circle Network invitation with some context from members who've already joined.

One SaaS founder told me their first intro led to a strategic partnership worth $180K in the first year. ROI was 72x on their membership.

A fintech CEO found their Series A lead investor through the platform. The AI matched them at 94% based on investment focus.

A PE partner said the quality of connections is 10x better than any other platform because everyone is vetted and accomplished.

The difference from other networking platforms is that instead of attending events, cold outreach, or hoping for random introductions, you get 3 AI-matched strategic connections every Monday. Warm introductions. High match accuracy. Directly access vetted professionals.

Current members include people from Y Combinator, Fortune 500 C-suites, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia, successful exit founders, and board members. All actively looking to connect.

You have {{deadline}} days left to use your invitation code ({{invite_code}}).

Premium is $4,997/year (strategic introductions, member directory, events).
Elite is $9,997/year (Premium plus AI Deal Flow, Reputation Guardian, Competitive Intelligence coming Q1 2026).

Both include 30-day money-back guarantee and our "3 wins in 90 days" performance guarantee.

Think this could be valuable for you? {{apply_url}}

Thanks,
Shehab

P.S. If you have questions about which tier makes sense, just reply and I can help you decide.
