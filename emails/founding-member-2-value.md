# Hook

Hi {{first_name}},

I sent you an invitation to join **Circle Network** a few days ago, and wanted to follow up in case it got buried in your inbox.

You're among a highly selective group being invited during our **founding member phase**—and there are only **{{deadline}} days left** to claim your spot at the locked-in price of $2,497/year.

After January 15, 2026, this same membership will cost $4,997-$9,997/year.
