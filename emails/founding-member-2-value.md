Hi {{first_name}},

Following up on the Circle Network invitation I sent a few days ago. I know inboxes get busy, so wanted to make sure you saw it.

You have {{deadline}} days left to join at the founding member rate of $2,497/year (locks in forever). After January 15th, the same membership will be $4,997-$9,997/year.

The core value is simple: every Monday, you get 3 AI-matched connections based on your goals. Accept the ones that interest you, and we make the introduction. No cold outreach, no networking eventsâ€”just strategic connections that make sense.

As a founding member, you also get lifetime access to all our AI tools at no extra cost (deal flow alerts, reputation monitoring, competitive intelligence launching Q1 2026). That's normally $4,991/year extra, but you get it included.

Here's what I've seen work: if even one connection this year creates $50K in value, your ROI is 20x. Most people make multiple valuable connections.

Your code is still {{invite_code}}. Does this sound like it could be useful for you?

Thanks,
Shehab
