Hi {{first_name}},

Wanted to help you choose between Premium and Elite by breaking down what each includes.

Premium ($4,997/year):
- AI-powered strategic introductions (3/week)
- Member directory and advanced search
- Direct messaging
- Events and expert sessions
- Deal flow marketplace access
- 30-day money-back guarantee

This is best for professionals focused on expanding their network and making strategic connections. If 1-2 connections create $100K in value this year, your ROI is 20x.

Elite ($9,997/year):
Everything in Premium, plus AI Deal Flow Alerts, Reputation Guardian, and Competitive Intelligence (launching Q1 2026).

Best for active investors looking for deal flow, executives who need reputation protection, and strategic thinkers who want competitive intelligence. If the AI suite prevents one $500K mistake or surfaces one 10x investment, your ROI is 50-500x.

About 60% join as Premium—they value strategic introductions and community access. About 40% join as Elite—they want the full AI suite. Many Premium members upgrade to Elite within 3-6 months once they see the value.

You have {{deadline}} days to use your invitation code ({{invite_code}}).

Which tier sounds like the right fit for you? {{apply_url}}

Both come with a 30-day money-back guarantee and our "3 wins in 90 days or +3 months free" guarantee. No long-term contracts—annual billing, cancel anytime.

Best,
Shehab

P.S. If you're unsure which tier makes sense for your situation, just reply and I can help you decide.
