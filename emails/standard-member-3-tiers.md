Hi {{first_name}},

Wanted to help you choose between our membership tiers by breaking down what each includes.

**Founding ($399/month):**
- AI-powered strategic introductions (3/week)
- Member directory and advanced search
- Direct messaging
- Events and expert sessions
- Deal flow marketplace access
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- Limited availability for founding members

This is best for early adopters who want to lock in the lowest rate. If 1-2 connections create value this year, your ROI is substantial.

**Premium ($299/month):**
- AI-powered strategic introductions (3/week)
- Member directory and advanced search
- Direct messaging
- Events and expert sessions
- Deal flow marketplace access
- 30-day money-back guarantee

This is best for professionals focused on expanding their network and making strategic connections. If 1-2 connections create significant value this year, your investment pays for itself.

**Elite ($499/month):**
Everything in Premium, plus AI Deal Flow Alerts, Reputation Guardian, and Competitive Intelligence (launching Q1 2026).

Best for active investors looking for deal flow, executives who need reputation protection, and strategic thinkers who want competitive intelligence. If the AI suite prevents one major mistake or surfaces one valuable opportunity, your ROI is exceptional.

Most members start with Founding or Premium—they value strategic introductions and community access. Many upgrade to Elite within 3-6 months once they see the value.

You have {{deadline}} days to use your invitation code ({{invite_code}}).

Which tier sounds like the right fit for you? {{apply_url}}

Both come with a 30-day money-back guarantee and our "3 wins in 90 days or +3 months free" guarantee. No long-term contracts—annual billing, cancel anytime.

Best,
Shehab

P.S. If you're unsure which tier makes sense for your situation, just reply and I can help you decide.
