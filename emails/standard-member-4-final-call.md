{{first_name}},

This is my final reminder about your Circle Network invitation. Your code expires in {{deadline}} days.

After that, you'll need to join the waitlist for the next opening.

What you get: 3 AI-matched strategic introductions every Monday, member directory with 250+ vetted professionals, direct messaging, events, and deal flow marketplace access. Elite members also get AI Deal Flow Alerts, Reputation Guardian, and Competitive Intelligence (launching Q1 2026).

Why join now: early member advantage (first choice of connections), current pricing (before any future increases), network effects (join while the community is most engaged), and input on what we build next.

We're different from LinkedIn (highly curated, every member vetted), masterminds (AI matches you with relevant people), and forums (direct 1-on-1 introductions facilitated automatically). Our AI matching has 85%+ accuracy.

Some feedback from members:

"I've made more valuable connections in 3 months on Circle Network than in 3 years on LinkedIn."

"The ROI was 50x in the first 6 months. One intro led to a $200K partnership."

"Best networking investment I've ever made. The quality of people and conversations is unmatched."

Your code is {{invite_code}}: {{apply_url}}

We have a 30-day money-back guarantee and a "3 wins in 90 days or +3 months free" guarantee. Zero risk.

Let me know if you have any questions?

P.S. After this email, I won't reach out again about this invitation. If you're not ready now, you can join the waitlist for the next opening.
