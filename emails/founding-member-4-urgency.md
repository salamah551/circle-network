{{first_name}},

This is my last message about your Circle Network invitation. Your code expires in {{deadline}} days.

After that, you'll miss the founding member pricing of $2,497/year locked in for life. It goes to $4,997-$9,997/year, and the Elite AI features that would be included free become an extra $4,991/year.

That's about $75K in value over 10 years that you'd lose.

I personally selected you for this invitation because I thought you'd be a valuable member of the community. If you're not interested, that's completely fineâ€”just know this opportunity won't come around again.

The founding member window was designed to reward early supporters. After {{deadline}} days, pricing increases permanently and there's no grandfathering.

We have a 30-day money-back guarantee and a "3 wins in 90 days or +3 months free" guarantee. So there's no risk to trying it.

Your code is {{invite_code}}: {{apply_url}}

Let me know if you have any questions?

P.S. After this email, I won't reach out again about this opportunity.
