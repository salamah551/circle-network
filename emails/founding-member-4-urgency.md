# Hook

{{first_name}},

This is my final message about your Circle Network invitation.

Your invitation code expires in **{{deadline}} days**, and after that, you'll miss the founding member pricing of $2,497/year—locked in for life.

# Value Proposition

## What You're About to Lose

❌ **$2,500/year savings** (forever)
❌ **$4,991/year** in Elite AI features (included free for founding members)
❌ **Founding Member Badge** and priority matching
❌ **First choice** of connections in the network

**Total value over 10 years: $74,910**

# Proof / Social Proof

I handpicked you for this invitation because I believe you'd be a valuable member of this community.

But if you're not interested, that's okay too—just know that this opportunity won't come around again.

## Why This Matters

The founding member window was designed to reward early supporters who help us build something special. After {{deadline}} days:

- Pricing increases to $4,997-$9,997/year
- Elite AI features require separate payment
- Founding member status is permanently closed
- No price protection or grandfathering

**This is your last chance to lock in lifetime benefits.**
