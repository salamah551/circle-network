Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question: what's one valuable connection worth to you?

I've been thinking about this a lot as we build Circle Network. A strategic partnership might be worth $250K. The right investor introduction could be priceless. A key hire that saves recruiting fees might be $150K.

The cost to join as a founding member is $2,497/year. If one connection this year creates $50K in value, that's a 20x return. Most people make several valuable connections.

Here's what our beta members have seen:

One SaaS founder's first intro led to a partnership that added $180K in ARR within 6 months.

A fintech CEO found their Series A lead investor through the platform. The AI matched them at 94% based on investment focus.

The quality of connections is consistently better than other platforms because everyone is vetted and accomplished.

The way it works is straightforward: every Monday, AI analyzes your profile and recommends 3 strategic connections. You see why each match makes sense, accept the ones you want, and we handle the introduction.

You have {{deadline}} days left to join at founding member pricing before it goes up to $4,997-$9,997/year. Your code is {{invite_code}}.

Think this could work for you?
