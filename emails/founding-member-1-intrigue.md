Hi {{first_name}},

I'm reaching out because I think you'd be a great fit for Circle Network. We're building a private community where accomplished professionals get matched with 3 strategic connections every week using AI.

You're among the first people I'm inviting during our founding member phase. If you join now, you'll lock in $2,497/year for life (it's going to $4,997+ after January 15th).

Here's what makes this different: instead of scrolling through profiles or attending networking events, our AI analyzes your goals and matches you with people who can actually help. You get 3 intros every Monday. If one sounds good, we make the introduction.

As a founding member, you also get lifetime access to all our AI features at no extra costâ€”deal flow alerts, reputation monitoring, competitive intelligence. These tools are launching in Q1 2026, but you'll have them included forever while others pay $4,997-$9,997 extra per year.

Your invitation code is {{invite_code}} and it's good for {{deadline}} days.

Let me know if this sounds interesting? You can apply here: {{apply_url}}

Best,
Shehab Salamah
Founder, Circle Network

P.S. If you have any questions, just reply to this email. I read every message.
