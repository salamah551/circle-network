## Security Verification

### Security Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded user IDs in client-side code (LockedFeature uses database field)
- [ ] Environment validation only exposes missing keys to dev/admin
- [ ] Server-side gates enforce authentication/subscription/onboarding
- [ ] CodeQL scan shows 0 alerts
- [ ] No secrets logged to console
- [ ] Admin detection uses database field, not client-side list

### Manual Security Checks
1. **Bypass Attempt**: Try to access `/dashboard` without completing onboarding
   - Should redirect, not render dashboard
2. **Inspect Bundle**: Check client bundle for hardcoded user IDs
   - Should NOT find any UUID strings in LockedFeature
3. **Network Inspection**: Monitor API calls during locked feature access
   - Should not expose admin user lists

## Regression Testing

### Existing Features to Verify
- [ ] Login/logout still works
- [ ] Subscription flow unchanged
- [ ] Existing dashboard widgets render
- [ ] All API routes still functional
- [ ] Other pages (not modified) still work
- [ ] Mobile responsive design intact

---

## Performance Tests

### Load Time Checks
- [ ] Dashboard loads in < 3 seconds (dev mode)
- [ ] Locked feature panel renders immediately
- [ ] No visible lag when checking environment variables
- [ ] Singleton client doesn't cause slowdowns

---

## Test Summary Checklist

After completing all tests, verify:
- [ ] All onboarding gates work correctly
- [ ] LockedFeature never shows blank pages
- [ ] No Supabase client instance warnings
- [ ] Environment banner shows appropriately
- [ ] ARC Elite limit is 50 by default
- [ ] All security checks pass

If any test fails:
1. Note the specific scenario and steps
2. Capture screenshots/console logs
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify environment variables are set correctly
5. Confirm database schema matches expectations
6. Check that code changes were deployed correctly
