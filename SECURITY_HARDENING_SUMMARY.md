# Security Hardening & Compliance - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Target Launch:** November 10, 2025 (21 days)  
**Status:** ✅ All must-have items completed

---

## Overview

This implementation addresses critical security, compliance, and conversion optimizations for Circle Network's soft launch. All changes are surgical and minimal, focused on hardening the platform without modifying core product functionality.

---

## 1. Stripe Security & Robustness

### 1.1 Portal Route Security ✅
**File:** `app/api/stripe/portal/route.js`

**Changes:**
- Replaced client-provided `x-user-id` header with server-side cookie-based authentication
- Now uses `@supabase/ssr` and `cookies()` from Next.js to fetch authenticated user
- Prevents user impersonation attacks

**Before:**
```javascript
const userId = (req.headers.get('x-user-id') || '').trim();
```

**After:**
```javascript
const { data: { user }, error: authError } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
```

### 1.2 Webhook Idempotency ✅
**File:** `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `webhook_events` table lookup before processing
- Records `event_id` to prevent duplicate processing
- Handles concurrent webhook deliveries gracefully

**New Table Required:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE webhook_events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  event_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_webhook_events_event_id ON webhook_events(event_id);
```

### 1.3 Customer ID Persistence ✅
**File:** `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.js`

**Changes:**
- Now persists `stripe_customer_id` in profiles on `checkout.session.completed`
- Enables proper billing portal access for all users

### 1.4 User ID Fallback Logic ✅
**File:** `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.js`

**Changes:**
- If `session.metadata.userId` is missing, attempts lookup via `customer_email`
- Prevents lost conversions due to metadata issues

### 1.5 Production Price ID Safety ✅
**File:** `app/api/stripe/checkout/route.js`

**Changes:**
- Removed hardcoded fallback price IDs in production
- Fails fast with clear error if environment variables not set
- Prevents accidental wrong-tier charges

---

## 2. Cron Reliability (Vercel)

### 2.1 Bulk Invites Cron Auth ✅
**File:** `app/api/bulk-invites/track/send/route.js`

**Changes:**
- Now accepts `x-vercel-cron: 1` header as authentication alternative
- Maintains backward compatibility with `CRON_SECRET`

### 2.2 Email Automation Cron Auth ✅
**File:** `app/api/email-automation/route.js`

**Changes:**
- Same `x-vercel-cron` header support
- Ensures reliable Vercel Cron invocation

### 2.3 Vercel Cron Configuration ✅
**File:** `vercel.json`

**Changes:**
- Added second cron job for `/api/email-automation` at 09:05 UTC
- Ensures daily automated email sequences run reliably

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/bulk-invites/track/send",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/email-automation",
      "schedule": "5 9 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 3. SendGrid Compliance & Webhook Verification

### 3.1 List Management Compliance ✅
**File:** `app/api/email-automation/route.js`

**Changes:**
- Removed `bypassListManagement: { enable: true }`
- Now honors SendGrid's unsubscribe/suppression lists
- Ensures CAN-SPAM compliance

### 3.2 Webhook Signature Verification ✅
**File:** `app/api/bulk-invites/webhook/route.js`

**Changes:**
- Implements RSA-SHA256 signature verification
- Uses `SENDGRID_EVENT_PUBLIC_KEY` environment variable
- Rejects invalid signatures with 401 status
- Prevents webhook spoofing attacks

**Verification Logic:**
```javascript
function verifySendGridSignature(publicKey, payload, signature, timestamp) {
  const timestampedPayload = timestamp + payload;
  const verifier = crypto.createVerify('RSA-SHA256');
  verifier.update(timestampedPayload);
  return verifier.verify(publicKey, signature, 'base64');
}
```

### 3.3 Suppression List Enforcement ✅
**File:** `app/api/bulk-invites/track/send/route.js`

**Changes:**
- Verified existing suppression logic is working correctly
- Checks `unsubscribes` table before sending
- Checks existing members table to prevent duplicate sends
- All emails include unsubscribe links

---

## 4. Legal/Brand/Pricing Consistency

4. Verify emails sent (check `bulk_invites` table status updates)
5. Verify `x-vercel-cron` header authentication works

**SendGrid Webhook:**
1. Configure webhook URL in SendGrid dashboard: `https://yourdomain.com/api/bulk-invites/webhook`
2. Add `SENDGRID_EVENT_PUBLIC_KEY` to environment variables
3. Send test email
4. Verify webhook events are recorded in `bulk_invite_events` table
5. Test with invalid signature - should receive 401

**Email Suppression:**
1. Add email to `unsubscribes` table
2. Trigger bulk invite send
3. Verify suppressed email is not sent (check logs)
4. Remove from unsubscribes
5. Verify it can be sent again

**Guarantee Display:**

## Environment Variables Required

### New Required:
- `SENDGRID_EVENT_PUBLIC_KEY` - RSA public key for webhook verification (get from SendGrid dashboard)

### Existing (verify configured):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## Database Migrations Required

Run this SQL in Supabase before deploying:

```sql
-- Create webhook_events table for idempotency
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS webhook_events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  event_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_webhook_events_event_id ON webhook_events(event_id);

-- Ensure profiles has stripe_customer_id column
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_customer_id TEXT;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_stripe_customer_id ON profiles(stripe_customer_id);
```

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Confidence Changes (Low Risk):
- Legal copy updates (brand name, pricing)
- Guarantee badge additions (pure content)
- Email CTA copy change
- Cron header authentication

### Medium Confidence Changes (Medium Risk):
- Stripe portal auth change - **Test thoroughly**
- Webhook idempotency - **Verify table exists**
- SendGrid signature verification - **Test with real webhook**

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. Deploy to staging environment first
2. Test all Stripe flows end-to-end
3. Monitor webhook processing logs
4. Keep CRON_SECRET as fallback during transition
5. Verify SendGrid event processing continues working

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Stripe Portal Issues:**
   - Revert `app/api/stripe/portal/route.js` to previous version
   - Quick fix: temporarily add back x-user-id support

2. **Webhook Issues:**
   - Remove idempotency check if table not created
   - Monitor for duplicate processing

3. **Cron Issues:**
   - Ensure CRON_SECRET is set and working
   - x-vercel-cron is additive, not replacing

4. **SendGrid Webhook Issues:**
   - Remove signature verification temporarily
   - Set SENDGRID_EVENT_PUBLIC_KEY to empty to skip verification

---

## Success Metrics

After deployment, monitor:

1. **Stripe Portal:**
   - Zero 401/404 errors from authenticated users
   - No support tickets about portal access

2. **Webhooks:**
   - Zero duplicate payment activations
   - 100% of checkouts result in profile activation

3. **Cron Jobs:**
   - Daily cron executions complete successfully
   - Email send counts match expectations

4. **SendGrid:**
   - No spoofed webhook events
   - All legitimate events processed
   - Unsubscribe rate remains stable

5. **Conversion:**
   - Track CTR on new "Unlock your 3 strategic introductions" button
   - Monitor guarantee section engagement (scroll depth)
   - Track refund request rate (should remain low with clear guarantees)

---

## Next Steps (Nice-to-Haves)

If time permits before launch:

1. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Add Upstash-based rate limiting to public endpoints
   - Target: `/api/unsubscribe`, `/api/invites/claim`

2. **NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL Assertions:**
   - Add presence checks at top of email routes
   - Fail fast on misconfiguration

3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Add more detailed logging to webhook handlers
   - Set up alerts for failed webhook processing

---

## Conclusion

All must-have items for the security hardening and compliance sprint are complete. The platform is significantly more secure and compliant:

✅ Server-side auth eliminates header trust vulnerabilities  
✅ Webhook idempotency prevents double-processing  
✅ SendGrid compliance ensures deliverability  
✅ Legal/brand consistency builds trust  
✅ Conversion primitives reduce friction  

**Ready for staging deployment and testing.**
